# GTF2.0 - Get The Flag üèÅ ‚è≥

### Flow:

1. The first script `script1.py` is a basic mathemtatical topic which we all have studied. But the logic is slightly flawed. Correct it to get a list of words. Input string to be supplied is: `owl`
2. The list of words you've received from the 1st script `script1.py` is to be passed to the 2nd script `script2.py`. If your input is right, you will successfully get the URL for a webpage, else correct the logic for the 1st script to get the right list of words.
3.
